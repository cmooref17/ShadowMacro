# ShadowMacro
Using hotkeys and such, you can start recording macros. Once started, you can use your mouse and keyboard however you'd like, and you can play these macros back almost exactly how you recorded it. You're able to speed up the macros, slow them down, and set them to loop forever until stopped.
